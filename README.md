# terrform-python-cicd

This project provides a CI/CD pipeline implementation that automates the deployment of infrastructure changes using Terraform and Python. The pipeline includes stages for Terraform initialization, planning, Python script execution, testing, artifact management, deployment, and more. The pipeline is designed to work with Jenkins as the CI/CD platform.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the CI/CD pipeline, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Jenkins installed and configured on your build server.
- Python installed on the build server.
- Terraform installed on the build server.
- Git repository to store your codebase and pipeline configurations.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and configure the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Clone the repository to your build server:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/kd9s0/terraform-python-cicd.git

2. Install the necessary dependencies, including Python and Terraform, on the build server.

3. Configure Jenkins to connect to your version control system and monitor changes in the repository. Set up a webhook or polling mechanism to trigger pipeline runs upon detecting changes.

4. Create a Jenkins pipeline using the provided pipeline configuration file (Jenkinsfile). Customize the file based on your project's requirements, such as adjusting stages, environment variables, or adding additional steps.

5. Set up any required credentials or secrets in Jenkins to securely store sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords.

6. Customize the Python scripts (*.py) to fit your specific requirements. These scripts will be responsible for triggering Terraform commands, processing Terraform output, and integrating with other tools in the pipeline.

7. Configure the pipeline triggers based on your desired criteria, such as manual triggers, scheduled runs, or events like code commits or pull requests.

8. Define appropriate environments, such as staging and production, and ensure that the pipeline can deploy to the correct environment based on the branch or input parameters.

9. Set up notifications and reporting mechanisms to keep the team informed about pipeline runs, successes, failures, and other relevant information.

10. Iterate and improve the pipeline based on feedback, pain points, and best practices. Continuously monitor and enhance the pipeline to streamline the deployment process.
